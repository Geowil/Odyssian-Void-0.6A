#For use with Space Crusade version 0.6A
#This file contains many values required for proper functioning of the game as related to database querying
#DO NOT CHANGE item id ranges unless you are adding new weapons or moving weapon blocks around.  Changing these without changing the database WILL break the game

[itemid]

#The ID ranges MUST BE congruent; they cannot stop and then restart at different values.  For example a range of 1 to 25 and then 28 to 34 will not work, it must be 1 to 34.
#ID ranges can be modified in either the Equipment_Data table


#Formatting For ID Ranges
#The way that the system works is by taking a value ID range pair and placing them into a vector.  In order for your items to
#show up correctly you will need to add your item ranges into the same slot as your new item type if you are adding
#a completely new item (say a new ship class).  An example of this is below.

#New Ship Class Example
#scnames = Fighter,Frigate,Destroyer,Cruiser....

#As you can see above, the Fighters class has been added to the front of the scnames string.  In order for these items to be correctly
#detected within the game, in your ID range string you must place your ID range, even if higher than those for Frigates, at the front of
#the ID range string as in the example below.

#New Ship ID Ranges for Fighters
#sidrstr = 6000-6020,1-8,31-37,61-69....



#Ship ID Ranges

#ID Range String formatting
#This string is VERY important as it will tell the game what range of IDs a specific item class' items reside in.  This list is
#numeration specific meaning that where you place the ID range matters.  If you move the ID range for cruisers, using ships as an example, (3rd value range) to the
#front of the string, then the game will register cruiser ships as frigate ships.  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MODDERS!  Where ever you place your new item
#class in the appropriate string for that item class' string (ships in scnames, weapons in wcnames etc.), your ID range must be in the same place here.  See the above example for details.

#The string is formatted thus: low end of the value range - high end of the value range and then use a comma (,) to signify that a new item class ID range has started.

sidrstr =1-8,31-37,61-69,91-97,121-127,151-156,181-187,211-220,229-233


#Starter Ship Range

#These two values will determine the range of the ships that are offered to the player at the start of the game as their starter ship.  You can change this to whatever just make sure the ID range
#covers items that are within a ship class range and that are not empty

ssrstr =1-5



#Weapon ID Ranges

#To determine which weapon type the key is for, look at the first character.  This character will be the first character of the weapon type it represents.
#l = laser|m = missile|b = bomb|r= railgun|h = heavy weapon

#IMPORTANT: For how these strings are formatted and other special considerations please read the comment blocks under Ship ID Ranges!
#This value is setup so that each weapon is in congruant order with the wcnames variable found below in the weapons section, each weapon type is separated by a semi-colon while the class ID
#ranges are divided using commas.

#The above also applies to the mining lasers class ID ranges variable found directly below

#You MUST HAVE at least one weapon for every ship class; this is imperitive.  If you do not you will break the loading mechanisms for weapon ID ranges at this time.

#Special Item Ranges

#The mining laser ID ranges are setup in similar fashion to the weapon ID ranges above but with a key difference.  The second grouping, after the semi-colon, is for mining lasers (used on mining barges) while the first section is for non-specifics (used on non-mining barges).  Please
#stick to this format.  If you add a new class of ship, you will need to add a range to the first half of this list where ever the new class is located at within the sctypes string.

#Planet Checks, Ranges, & Values

#Planet Size Random Range - Modify this to get bigger or smaller planets
#This value is used to determine the method by which planet sizes are checked.  If a random value within this range falls within a certain range within the range (say 120 to 300)
#then the planet size must not be within a checked size range in order for the planet to be created (so less than 1.2 or greater than 1.8 for example, which happens to be for type 0 planets).

#On the other hand, if the random value from this range is not within the checked range (so if the value is under 120 or over 300) then the planet size must be within the checked range
#in order for the planet to be created (so anywhere from 1.2 to 1.8).

#Changing this range will give you wider or smaller areas to work with which in turn affect the way which planets are checked and allowed to be created.  However if you do change this be sure
#to change the check ranges listed directly below this value to account for what you have changed here.

psvrstr = 1-1000


#Planet EKS Range

#Increasing this value (increase by 1000 for each new type) will add new planet types to the game.  If you increase this value be sure to add
#the corresponding values to the ranges below.  You can also lower it which will reduce the planet class types by 1 type per 1000 and make the game much harder (be sure to edit
#the equipment database and move the planetary equipment type field for the type classifications you have removed.  You will also need to edit the item type ID ranges for p. equipment as well).

peksrange = 1.0-5000.0


#Planet Type Values

#All of the information below pertains to the key titled 'ptvrstrs'.  The information is ordered by how that specific information is placed in the value for the specified key.  So the first value in each section (sections are segmented by
#semi-colons) is the range for the planet type.  The second value is the planet size random check and so on.

#Planet Type Ranges

#The following ranges determine what class of planet certain eks value ranges fall under and the size the planet must be.  Modify these to make the game easier or harder (more higher class planets for example)
#Editing the first two values from each type will also affect how defenses and shields are applied

#Like the item class ID ranges above, these will also be in a similar format.  The values determine the value range for which a planet type is designated (0.1 to 0.9 means that the planet is a Type 0 planet
#for example but you can change that range to make more planets Type 0s or less planets Type 0s.  You will need to adjust the other type ranges to compensate though).  

#The format for these values is in comma-delimited fashion to block on each range for each existing planet type (all of the planet types have to have a range like this and they must
#mimic the order of the planet types (so type 1 to typ 5 default).  Changing these will have a drastic impact on the size of planets within a given planet type.

#Planet Size Randoms

#These values determine the possible range of planet sizes within a specific planet type category.  There should be some overlap between the groups but not too much.  Sizes start at 1.0 for Type 0 and end
#with 10.0 for Type 5 by default but you can change these.  Note that setting these values too low or too high can result in unbalanced gameplay.

#The format for this string below is a low and a high value separated by hyphens and each planet type separated by commas.  You must have a value range for each planet type and they must be listed in congruent order
#to the order of your planet types (so 1-5 default, add new ranges for new planet types at the end).  For best results when adding new planet types add new value ranges and do not expand the 10.0 default max.

#Planet Outlier Check Ranges - modify this larger or smaller to effect the number of outlier planets to in-range planets

#These are broken down into two groups in the code.  The use of these two values is the range for planet sizes that are outliers for that planet type (so like a type 0 planet that is less than 1.2 or
#greater than 1.8 in size if the random value for this FALLS WITHIN the stated range below).  The second group of two values is the range for planet sizes that are in the appropriate size zone (between 1.2 and 1.8 for type 0
#if the random value for this FALLS OUTSIDE of the stated range below).  How you set these up is up to you but know that the more unbalanced these become the more unbalanced the game has 
#a chance of becoming (like having too many outlier planets).

#Each group of values is separated by a ‘,’ which signifies a new planet type.  You must have a range for each planet type and they must be in congruent order to your planet types (so no value range for
#type 4 planets before type 3's value range).  For the most even results, make all of these the same.  However making these smaller will mean less outlier planets and making them bigger will mean more
#outliers.

#Planet Size Check Ranges

#These values are very similar to the Planet Size Random Check Ranges in how they work in the code.  What they do is slightly different though.  These values indicate what a normal size planet for a specific planet
#type is versus what would be considered an outlier.  These ranges should be a set of values WITHIN the value range for their planet type listed directly above (so 1.2 to 1.8 for Type 0).  For best results do not make these ranges too wide 
#or the chance of getting outliers will be lower or if you want more outliers then make these ranges smaller.
